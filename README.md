# Mustache

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/mustache.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/mustache)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mustache/mustache.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mustache/mustache)

Inspired by [ctemplate][1] and [et][2], Mustache is a
framework-agnostic way to render logic-free views.

As ctemplates says, "It emphasizes separating logic from presentation:
it is impossible to embed application logic in this template language."

For a list of implementations (other than Ruby) and tips, see
<http://mustache.github.io/>.


## Overview

Think of Mustache as a replacement for your views. Instead of views
consisting of ERB or HAML with random helpers and arbitrary logic,
your views are broken into two parts: a Ruby class and an HTML
template.

We call the Ruby class the "view" and the HTML template the
"template."

All your logic, decisions, and code is contained in your view. All
your markup is contained in your template. The template does nothing
but reference methods in your view.

This strict separation makes it easier to write clean templates,
easier to test your views, and more fun to work on your app's front end.


## Why?

I like writing Ruby. I like writing HTML. I like writing JavaScript.

I don't like writing ERB, Haml, Liquid, Django Templates, putting Ruby
in my HTML, or putting JavaScript in my HTML.


## Installation

Install the gem locally with:

    $ gem install mustache

Or add it to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "mustache", "~> 1.0"
```


## Usage

Quick example:

    >> require 'mustache'
    => true
    >> Mustache.render("Hello {{planet}}", planet: "World!")
    => "Hello World!"

We've got an `examples` folder but here's the canonical one:

```ruby
class Simple < Mustache
  def name
    "Chris"
  end

  def value
    10_000
  end

  def taxed_value
    value * 0.6
  end

  def in_ca
    true
  end
end
```

We simply create a normal Ruby class and define methods. Some methods
reference others, some return values, some return only booleans.

Now let's write the template:

    Hello {{name}}
    You have just won {{value}} dollars!
    {{#in_ca}}
    Well, {{taxed_value}} dollars, after taxes.
    {{/in_ca}}

This template references our view methods. To bring it all together,
here's the code to render actual HTML;
```ruby
Simple.render
```
Which returns the following:

    Hello Chris
    You have just won 10000 dollars!
    Well, 6000.0 dollars, after taxes.

Simple.


## Tag Types

For a language-agnostic overview of Mustache's template syntax, see
the `mustache(5)` manpage or
<http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html>.


## Escaping

Mustache does escape all values when using the standard double
Mustache syntax. Characters which will be escaped: `& \ " < >` (as
well as `'` in Ruby `>= 2.0`). To disable escaping, simply use triple
mustaches like `{{{unescaped_variable}}}`.

Example: Using `{{variable}}` inside a template for `5 > 2` will
result in `5 &gt; 2`, where as the usage of `{{{variable}}}` will
result in `5 > 2`.


## Dict-Style Views

ctemplate and friends want you to hand a dictionary to the template
processor. Mustache supports a similar concept. Feel free to mix the
class-based and this more procedural style at your leisure.

Given this template (winner.mustache):

    Hello {{name}}
    You have just won {{value}} bucks!

We can fill in the values at will:

```ruby
view = Winner.new
view[:name] = 'George'
view[:value] = 100
view.render
```
Which returns:

    Hello George
    You have just won 100 bucks!

We can re-use the same object, too:

```ruby
view[:name] = 'Tony'
view.render # => Hello Tony\nYou have just won 100 bucks!
```

## Templates

A word on templates. By default, a view will try to find its template
on disk by searching for an HTML file in the current directory that
follows the classic Ruby naming convention.

    TemplatePartial => ./template_partial.mustache

You can set the search path using `Mustache.template_path`. It can be set on a
class by class basis:

```ruby
class Simple < Mustache
  self.template_path = __dir__
end
```
Now `Simple` will look for `simple.mustache` in the directory it resides
in, no matter the cwd.

If you want to just change what template is used you can set
`Mustache.template_file` directly:

```ruby
Simple.template_file = './blah.mustache'
```
Mustache also allows you to define the extension it'll use.

```ruby
Simple.template_extension = 'xml'
```
Given all other defaults, the above line will cause Mustache to look
for './blah.xml'

Feel free to set the template directly:

```ruby
Simple.template = 'Hi {{person}}!'
```

Or set a different template for a single instance:
```ruby
Simple.new.template = 'Hi {{person}}!'
```

Whatever works.


## Views

Mustache supports a bit of magic when it comes to views. If you're
authoring a plugin or extension for a web framework (Sinatra, Rails,
etc), check out the `view_namespace` and `view_path` settings on the
`Mustache` class. They will surely provide needed assistance.


## Helpers

What about global helpers? Maybe you have a nifty `gravatar` function
you want to use in all your views? No problem.

This is just Ruby, after all.

```ruby
module ViewHelpers
  def gravatar
    gravatar_id = Digest::MD5.hexdigest(self[:email].to_s.strip.downcase)
    gravatar_for_id(gravatar_id)
  end

  def gravatar_for_id(gid, size = 30)
    "#{gravatar_host}/avatar/#{gid}?s=#{size}"
  end

  def gravatar_host
    @ssl ? 'https://secure.gravatar.com' : 'http://www.gravatar.com'
  end
end
```

Then just include it:

```ruby
class Simple < Mustache
  include ViewHelpers

  def name
    "Chris"
  end

  def value
    10_000
  end

  def taxed_value
    value * 0.6
  end

  def in_ca
    true
  end

  def users
    User.all
  end
end
```

Great, but what about that `@ssl` ivar in `gravatar_host`? There are
many ways we can go about setting it.

Here's an example which illustrates a key feature of Mustache: you
are free to use the `initialize` method just as you would in any
normal class.

```ruby
class Simple < Mustache
  include ViewHelpers

  def initialize(ssl = false)
    @ssl = ssl
  end
end
```

Now:

```ruby
Simple.new(request.ssl?).render
```

Finally, our template might look like this:

    <ul>
      {{# users}}
        <li><img src="{{ gravatar }}"> {{ login }}</li>
      {{/ users}}
    </ul>


## Integrations

### Sinatra

Sinatra integration is available with the
[mustache-sinatra gem](https://github.com/mustache/mustache-sinatra).

An example Sinatra application is also provided:
<https://github.com/defunkt/mustache-sinatra-example>

If you are upgrading to Sinatra 1.0 and Mustache 0.9.0+ from Mustache
0.7.0 or lower, the settings have changed. But not that much.

See [this diff][diff] for what you need to
do. Basically, things are named properly now and all should be
contained in a hash set using `set :mustache, hash`.


### [Rack::Bug][4]

Mustache also provides a `Rack::Bug` panel.
First you have to install the `rack-bug-mustache_panel` gem, then in your `config.ru` add  the following code:

```ruby
require 'rack/bug/panels/mustache_panel'
use Rack::Bug::MustachePanel
```

Using Rails? Add this to your initializer or environment file:

```ruby
require 'rack/bug/panels/mustache_panel'
config.middleware.use "Rack::Bug::MustachePanel"
```

![Rack::Bug][5]


### Vim

vim-mustache-handlebars is available at [mustache/vim-mustache-handlebars][vim]

### Emacs

mustache-mode.el is available at [mustache/emacs][emacs]


### TextMate

[Mustache.tmbundle][tmbundle]

See <https://gist.github.com/defunkt/323624> for installation instructions.


### Command Line
